# US/UK-English-Converter
There are over 1 700 words that have some sort of a diffrence in UK/US english. This tool will quickly convert entire articles from one to the other in a few seconds.

## Quickstart
For information about how to use the software please refer to the [wiki]().


## Development
Currently the converter only converts words that have diffrent spelling, such as color and colour. I soon hope to have the option to translate terms such as hood and bonnet, not just from US to UK, but aslo to AU and Canadian English. In future I aslo intend to add a GUI to the tool for easier use. If you wish to help with development, please contact me.
